# Project-4---Netflix-Stock-Price-Prediction

Dataset Details: This Netflix Stock Prices dataset consists of the following attributes [“high”, “low”, “volume”, “adj_close”, “close”]

Objective: To develop a predictive model using historical data of Netflix’s stock prices, with the aim of accurately forecasting future prices based on a range of key attributes including low, volume, adj close, high & close. 
The main purpose of this project is to build a machine learning model that can predict Netflix’s stock prices in the future. I will be specifically using the Time-Series Analysis to make a prediction of the stock prices. 

Hypothesis to prove/disprove: The historical data of Netflix’s stock prices indicates a significant correlation between the low, volume, adj close, high & close attributes. Therefore, it is possible to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts future stock prices based on these attributes. 
Basically, this hypothesis statement outlines the belief that these attributes have a strong influence on the stock price and that a machine learning model can be developed to leverage this relationship to accurately predict the future Netflix stock prices.
